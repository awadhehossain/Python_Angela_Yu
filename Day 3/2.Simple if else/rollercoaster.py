# Learn to use conditionals in Python to check a conditions 
# and tell the computer what to do in each case. e.g.

# if <this condition is true>:
# <then execute this line of code>

# What if the condition is false?
# The else keyword is used to define a block of code that will execute
# if the condition checked in the if statement is false.  

# Comparator Operators
# > Greater than
# < Less than
# >= Greater than or equal to
# <= Less than or equal to
# == Equal to
# != Not equal to
   
# one equal = means you assigning something (Its simply called assignment operator)  
# Two equal == means  yow check the equality (Its simply called conditional operator)
