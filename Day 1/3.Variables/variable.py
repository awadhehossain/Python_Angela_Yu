# Learn to store values in containers for later use.
#  Variables is a concept in programming that allows 
# us to give a label to a piece of data 
# so that we can refer or reference that data using the chosen variable name.

a=12
b=3.45
c=True
d="Awadhe"

# a,b,c,d both of them are variables but stored different data
# Variable work like as a containers which contains data 

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)

#After printing we can see that evey variable print those dat whis was initialize first.

# Make sure your variable names are descriptive
# Don't have spaces between words
# Don't start with numbers
# Don't use special words like print or input as avariable name
# Choose simple words that are less likely to become typos

# Note:Don't use backspace or tab before starting a python code line
#It gives you error.
