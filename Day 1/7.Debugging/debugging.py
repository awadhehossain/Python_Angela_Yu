# Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

print(Notes from Day 1")
 print("The print statement is used to output strings")
print("Strings are strings of characters"
priint("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
print(("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")


#solution
print("Notes from Day 1") # SyntaxError: invalid syntax(need a double qoutes to identify where the string start and where it ends)
print("The print statement is used to output strings")# Before start a line useing backspace ,tab gives error
print("Strings are strings of characters")# Ending first braces
print("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")#Print function spelling error
print("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")# Extra first braces
