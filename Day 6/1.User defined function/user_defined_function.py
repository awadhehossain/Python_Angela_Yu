# A function is some short of instraction with in a defined instraction
# To access all of the instraction all we just need to call that defined function

# Ways to make a cusstom defined function
# 1. need to write (def) means defining a thing
# 2. need to give a name to the function.
# 3. then a pair of first brace
# 4. then use a :
# 5. then need to add the instractions
# 6. Lastly need to call the function by that functions name

def my_function():
    print("Hello world")
    print("THis is my first programme.")
# Calling the function   
my_function()
